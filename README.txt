Use Python 3 to run the programs.

Put the images and speech data in the same directory of the code

1) TO run the KNN program just run the KNN.py file and give the input of image/speech dataset and Value of K as prompted.

2) To run the Ergodic HMM/Non-ergodic HMM run ErgodicDHMM.py or nonErgodicDHMM.py as respectively and it will prompt to input Dataset and values of N and M. Entered values of N and M    will be same for all the classes.
